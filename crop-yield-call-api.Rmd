First, let's construct our base URL.

```{r}
library(httr)

b_url <- "https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/crop-yield-api/crop-yield"

```


Now, we can use `modify_url()` to update the base URL with our parameters.

```{r}

params <- list(.year = 1975, .product = "beans", .entity = "germany")

query_url <- modify_url(url = b_url, query = params)

query_url
```


It's time to send the request using the appropriate method - in this case, GET.

```{r}
res <- GET(query_url)

res
```


We need to parse the response, which is in JSON, to work with it in R.

```{r}
resp_raw <- content(res, as = "text")

resp_raw

jsonlite::fromJSON(resp_raw)
```
